# Jogging is getting Boring
## Oliver Norred, 30 November 2020

Before the pools closed, I swam; before the gyms closed, I lifted a little bit. This supplemented my jogging habit, kept it fresh.

Now, dare I call them jogs when they feel like slogs? I do like FitnessBlender®’s 20-Minute Brutal HIIT Ladder Workout, but even that can get old.

Maybe I ought to start *running*—sprinting, for a desired time. I think self-competition like that might add some spice. I’ll find a good, available track sometime soon.

This is, like, the smallest problem one could have during a pandemic. I’m insanely lucky it’s my biggest.
