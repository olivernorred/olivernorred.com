# Boredom sucks
## Oliver Norred, 15 November 2020

Riley and I are making a readable, navigable home for [all the books in Skyrim](https://skyrimbooksproj.web.app).

This entails pasting in a ton ([ton!!!](generalassets/skyrimbooksproj-list.txt)) of HTML. It takes forever and it isnâ€™t that fun. Seconds feel like days.

I am reminded of the wonderful people who volunteer their time and energy for a nonprofit or an open-source software. So much of the necessary work is boring, but it is a great service to people around the world (around the world). I wish I were as good as them.

We set a deadline to finish by Christmas.
