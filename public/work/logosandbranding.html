			<h1>A wordmark and logo for the Graduate Students of Art History at UW</h1>
			<p>In the process of building their website, I made a wordmark for the GSAH. They&rsquo;re in the School of Art, so the pressure was on.</p>

			<h1>A logo and merch mockups for Fordham University&rsquo;s premiere a cappella group</h1>
			<p>The Hot Notes needed a new logo to match their rivals&rsquo;, the B-Sides. My brother, a singer in the Hot	Notes, reached out to me to create something bold and organic.</p>
			<p>A cappella music is a genre with no machinery. The most industrialized thing you&rsquo;ll see onstage at a Hot Notes concert is a pitch pipe and their bright red uniforms. Other than that, it&rsquo;s all vocal cords and larynxes. My logo-wordmark evokes this same humanity, while retaining the boldness of live choral music.</p>
