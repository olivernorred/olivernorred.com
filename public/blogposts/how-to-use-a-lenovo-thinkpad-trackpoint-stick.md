# How to use a Lenovo<sup>®</sup> Thinkpad™ TrackPoint™ Stick
## Oliver Norred, 2 August 2019
Also called a nipple mouse. Maybe I’m just not used to it. I think what I need to do is just block myself from using the touchpad until I finally can navigate using this red devil. I got the sensitivity to a point where I like it, but even still, my pointer is wearing roller skates.


Currently, I put my right pointer on the nipple and my left thumb on the clicker, but I have considered right middle on the nipple and right pointer on the clicker. After all, I have no experience clicking with my thumbs. *Shout out gamers.*
