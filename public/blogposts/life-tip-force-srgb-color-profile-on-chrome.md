# Life tip: force sRGB color profile on Chrome
## Oliver Norred, 5 November 2020

Chrome makes colors dull, and it bums me out! The YouTube red is almost brown, and some blues wax gray. Open your browsing session in Firefox and, if you’re a moth person like me, you’ll just want more and more of those sweet, sweet brights. Go to [chrome://flags](chrome://flags), search “*force color profile*,” and in the dropdown menu change the setting from *default* to *sRGB*.

Now, your reds will shout and your light blues will sing! Chrome will forever do justice to your hex codes!

In celebration, here’s a huge, bright red square, ready for you to soak in.

`#FF0000` to your heart’s content:

<div style="
background-color: #ff0000;
width: 200px;
height: 200px;
margin: auto;
border-radius:0;
"></div>
