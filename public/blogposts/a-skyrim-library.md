# A Skyrim Library
## Oliver Norred, 22 December 2020

Finally finished.

The Skyrim Library project has content from every book in Skyrim. I wrote none of it. [Riley](https://rileysamuelhuston.com) and I got it all from an ugly<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> source and prettified<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> it.

Looking back, I should have put a [curly-quote–maker](https://gist.github.com/drdrang/705071) in my [html puker](https://olivernorred.com/misc), which we used. I’m sorry I didn’t do that, Riley.

It’s not completely done until we implement <span class="special-christmas-mode-indicator">Christmas Mode</span>, but I urge you to [check it out](https://skyrimbooksproj.web.app). Send me an email if you’d change something—it’s a lot to think about for just Riley and a dud!

1. [The Imperial Library](https://www.imperial-library.info/), a community-driven, super extensive site. [Lady N](https://www.imperial-library.info/users/lady-n), whoever you are, *props*.
2.	Changed straight quotes to curly, “smart” quotes, made headers big.
