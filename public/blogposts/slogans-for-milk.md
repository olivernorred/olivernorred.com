# Slogans for Milk
## Oliver Norred, 30 August 2020
I’ve been coming up with slogans for Milk. I know it already has the “GOT MILK?” campaign, but come on! These slogans practically write themselves:

<p class="smallcaps">Milk: It Practically Markets Itself!</p>

<p class="smallcaps">Milk: You Won’t Feel The Same Afterwards!</p>

<p class="smallcaps">Milk: It’s Like Drinking Its Weight In Ice Cream!</p>

<p class="smallcaps">Milk: You Can Grow Into Lactose Intolerance At Any Age!</p>

Of the three, I think the second most intensely appeals to the pathos. I’ll add more when I think of more ways that Milk impacts my life. Thanks for reading!
