# Cool use for the en dash (–)
## Oliver Norred, 8 September 2020
I was looking up which dash properly ends a casual letter or email, as in:

>. . .
\
Anyway, I hope you have a really awesome life :)
\
\
-Oliver
\
or
\
–Oliver
\
or
\
—Oliver

I didn’t find out because I got distracted by this awesome use of the en dash, from the Grammarly Blog:

>Using the En Dash to Denote a Connection
\
The en dash may also be used to indicate a connection between two words. Use an en dash when you need to connect terms that are already hyphenated or when you are using a two-word phrase as a modifier. When the dash is used in this way, it creates a compound adjective. See the following examples:
\
\
•The pro-choice–pro-life argument is always a heated one.
\
•The Nobel Prize–winning author will be reading from her book at the library tonight.

You can catch me using these en dash–hungry cases any time!


Pretty sure em dashes end letters.
