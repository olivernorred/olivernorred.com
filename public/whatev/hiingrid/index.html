Shel Silverstein
If there’s one thing I wouldn’t do
It’s take a shoehorn to my shoe
After I had stepped in poo
In the tiger cage at the zoo!

The Onus
Wouldn’t it be lovely to shrink down to the stature of an action figure, such that one could rest on the sternum of one’s significant other? Well, maybe the onus is really on that very other, that he should grow to the size of a tree or a titan or a mammoth, thus allowing the one of normal size to rest on the aforedescribed sternum in the same manner as an action figure on a normalsized person.

Think about fall
Finally, spring, my favorite
But Ingrid said Think about fall
So I thought about fall
fall, the leaves on the ground and the sudden, narrow warmth of the sun and fall, a reasonable 7-o’-clock sunset and autumnal blossoms and harvest celebrations and feasts. There’s so much to look forward to!

No
You said you haven’t been liking music the same
And I’m scared. I’ve noticed getting older turns us jaded and sad-by-default and lonely
But the jaded, sad, and lonely make better use of music, music whose purpose is to inspire and console and keep us company
Plus, are we really getting older if we have cool shit bumpin in our headphones?

Forgiving
Tidepooling has me thinking about forgiveness.
Those jelly creatures, so fragile, shirking from touch and drought and heat.
You and I, on the other hand, so tough. We put glue on our hands for fun. We swim in nasty water. We get scraped up and sunburnt and our skin forgives and forgives.

The way it is
Your penmanship is much better than mine.
Out of jealousy and insecurity, I resort
to justifying the way it is with childhood stereotypes:
You’re a girl, so it’s never really been fair.

Wtf??
It’s hard to believe,
sometimes,
that you’re not invincible.
Sock after Punch after Hit after Blow from this Thing Called Life.
And when you bounce back from an especially nasty-looking combo, it’s like, how did she…??

I just know
You’re like if biking around and stopping whenever you feel like for lunch from the deli and the weather’s perfect was a person

Good lunch
For lunch today I brought
That one time we went hiking and wading and cliff jumping
That thing of where you text me recent pictures of me and I’m like ok
Tots
And brussels sprouts.

Every year
The ugly years were every year
That ever happened
Before September 19, 2000
A spider (or, Good and Evil)
A spider in my bed is evil and terrible and should wither and die or explode instantly under my very gaze.
A spider on the porch or in the window is good and precious and should live to be 100 or older.

I think
On a bench
We just work
Like it’s something about that shape of our sits
We just sort of work on a bench
It’s something about how you and me next to each other but seated and facing the same direction
Just on a bench we just work.

That sort of meter
You always sort of talk in poetry
You have that sort of meter, in a sense,
To your speech,
That just makes it easy to follow and to listen to
And such and such
Probably you do so on account of your very impressive recitations of poems and rhymes and songs
But also probably you do so on account of your magical and majestic way of going about life

Promise
Thanks for all those bites
Of your sandwiches and fries and cake and cookies and scones and tots and burgers and shakes
I’ll get you back someday

24
The rest of your life is gonna be so new
And exciting and weird
And it’s gonna be so messed up
And it’s gonna just draw on and on
And it’s gonna be so worth it

The joy
The athlete is the person who serves the team
For nothing but the joy
She passes thrice more than she shoots
Cause teamwork is beautiful
She instantly makes confident calls because being wrong is better than hesitating
She hustles cause she’d rather be tired than cold and stiff
It’s awesome.

The grammoller
Later, when the grammoller comes to our part of town, we’re gonna go out on Fimitter and plun our burrits real good, and he’s gonna drum up some serious chun. Every tribweller this side of Pargerary is gonna budge up and down that grit of Fimitter, but we’ll get out, say, div past swech, and we’ll get the crodest grammols he has to cray. We’ll trob as soon as we can find a flit to cread and we’ll just hom right in. I’m honestly tervinged!

Back when
Back when we got up this morning
And just like every other day made
A heroic effort to help others and do good
Back when just a second ago
We breathed in again and felt that healthy buzz that runs in our heads at all times
We were so smart back when just now

We singers
When the sun sets
We singers come out
We screech and squeal
And holler and hoot and call out
And our perfect sopranos are perfect
And our perfect baritones are perfect
And everyone loves us

Secrets
I like to keep a few secrets,
Like am I just always doing laundry
Or do I only do laundry whenever you’re around?
I’ll never tell.

The Car
It was
So tired
In there.
But now it’s raining and we’re in the wet car.

Argument
No cause I’m pretty sure
it said Be So Safe and Have Fun
And I really wish we’d’ve taken a picture
Cause that would resolve it once and for all
But that’s just what I think.
And at the same time it’s kind of fun to remember.

tryingamember
Also I’m tryingamember if regular is what regular people do
And normal is what we normally do
Or if normal is what normal people do
And regular is what we regularly do

24 part 2
Think about your whole life
up till now
I’m pretty sure that’s about how long it’s gonna feel when you’re
48
Mind blown yet?
