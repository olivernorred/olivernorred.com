<h1>Basically, officially, essentially, this page isn’t here anymore.</h1>

<p>Listen, I’m really sorry about that. But here’s the deal: you can go back to:</p>

<p><a href="/">... the homepage?</a></p>

<p><a href="/blog/">... my blog?</a></p>

<p><a href="/work/">... my design portfolio?</a></p>

<p>yep, any of those should work. Happy to have you. Much love!</p>
