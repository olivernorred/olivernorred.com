<strong>2. These Pants</strong>

<em>[blues clues theme bass line]</em>

<em>[various percussive sounds]</em>

IIIIIIIII’mm convinced you care about my style.

I tryyyyy to win you over; it’s worth my while.

So won’t you pleeeeeeeeeease notice me?
I’ll sit such that my shoes
are there for you to see!

<em>[warbly intermelody]</em>

IIIIIIIII’m invisible to you, my friend.
But I’ll draw your eyyyyyyes
to these old pants my neighbor lent.

So won’t you pleeeeeeeeeeeeease notice me?
I’ll sit such that these pants
are there for you to see!

<em>[warbly intermelody]</em>

<em>[wah wah bass]</em>

<em>[funner drum loop]</em>

These pants strangle my thighs
I hope they’ll catch your eyes
I know that it’s deadly (deadly!) 
to demand attention via fashion
but I hope these drawers draw your gaze
to me, to me, to me, to me!

These pants weigh on my hips
tunnel vision till my legs buckle
all I see are youurrr lips
smile, turn, make me look fear in the mouth
oh dear, cryin out
to make contact with your contacts
just a word, a word.

<em>[piano outro]</em>
<em>[synth chord]</em>


<strong>3. Be Still, I’ll Stay</strong>

<em>[breathing]</em>

Sing me a lullaby
to make me sure that you’re here toni ght.
You’re here tonight.
You’re here tonight.
I’m here tonight,
with you, with you, with yo u,
I’ll sta y.

Sing me the warbler’s song.
I know our wai t till morning’s long.
Lay patiently.
Still here I’ll b e.
Still he re I’ll be,
be still, be still, b e still,
I’ll sta y.

Promise me you won’t fly away.
I can’t sleep. I just hope you’ll say,
"Be stil l, I’ll stay.
Be still, I’ll sta y.
Be still, I’ll stay
with you to n i g h t."

<em>[organ shakily teleports closer]</em>


<strong>4. You Can Already Dance</strong>

Pretend you’ve got nothing to prove!
You’ve got some limbs to move.
I see you’ve bought a pair of shoes.
Those soles will come in use.

You have to give yourself a chance!
Might shut your eyes; don’t glance.
Just have a blast and shake your pants!
You! Can! Al! Rea! Dy! Dance!

<em>[kick kick kick snare]</em>

<em>[square wave solo]</em>

<em>[bridge bass line, claps]</em>

You can already dance
better than anybody could possibly teach you to!
You can already dance
better than anybody could possibly teach you to!
You can already dance
better than anybody could possibly teach you to!
You can already dance
better than anybody could!

It is a style unto your own;
go on and claim your throne
of dancing like yourself alone!
There’s no one else, you’ve shown.

You have to give yourself a chance!
Might close your eyes; don’t glance.
Just have a blast and shake your pants.
You! Can! Al! Rea! Dy! DAAAAAAAAAA-

<em>[kick kick kick snare]</em>


<strong>5. For the Friend Collector</strong>

<em>[snare snare]</em>

Friend-collecting, number-taking kid:
What gives? What gives?

Call em; they’ll agree to let you in.
New friends! You win!

Obviously you’ve got people too
They’ll do. They’ll do.

But you proclaim you want something new.
Why now? Why you?

You’re so desperate for approval,
you accept that your removal
from a group of precious people
is a necessary evil.

Old friends heed your beck and call,
but all you’ve shown through your withdrawal
is maybe they’d be better off
if you were never close at all.

Know that even when someone’s unkind,
you’ll find the time

to think of all the sources of sunshine.
Keep them in mind.
