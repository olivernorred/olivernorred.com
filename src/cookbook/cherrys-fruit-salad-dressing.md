# Fruit Salad Dressing

This cooked dressing is good on fresh, cut-up fruit.  It keeps the fruit from browning for an hour or two, and is good for a crowd with burgers. I use fresh pineapple, straw, rasp and blueberries, green grapes and bananas.  Combine the ingredients in a blender, pour into a double boiler, stirring a bit as it thickens. Be sure to use a little pineapple juice stirred into the cornstarch before putting into the blender! You can keep this dressing in the fridge and use it in several salads for weeks!
