# Banana Pancakes

*Stranded on a deserted island, sunburnt, dazed, and clutching a single banana and an egg, I grew ravenously hungry. Despite the option of simply eating the banana and egg separately, I realized I wanted to complicate things. Luckily, I had a wood burning fire, a pan, and a little bit of spice. I whipped this up in no time and the delicious smell attracted Ol’ Ben, a sea monster from 1605, who took me on a tour of the seafloor in return for one bite.*

### Ingredients

- <qu>1</qu> slightly old and soft banana 
- <qu>1</qu> egg 

### Directions

1. Take your banana and mash it up completely with a fork. Eviscerate it. Now crack an egg into it. The whole egg. Trust me. Keep mashing. Add cinnamon if you want. 
2. Pour the glop into a greased pan on medium heat and cook it for a few minutes. Don’t make it a scramble. Think more like a pancake. 
3. Flip it if you have the talent.

***Serve hot!***
