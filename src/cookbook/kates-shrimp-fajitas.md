# Shrimp Fajitas

### Step 1: cut . . .

. . . <ing>half an onion</ing>, a <ing>red bell pepper</ing> and <ing>orange bell pepper</ing> however shape you want (usually strips or diced is good), and thaw and prepare the <ing>shrimp</ing>

- make sure they are de-veined and the tails are removed (I usually buy the precooked frozen ones that are already deveined from QFC)

### Step 2: sauté the shrimp

- heat up a medium to large skillet with some <ing>olive oil</ing>
- Add in shrimp (usually about 6 per person but it’s up to the chef)
- As the shrimp are cooking, add in some <ing>lime juice</ing>, <ing>chili powder</ing>, <ing>cumin</ing>, <ing>garlic powder</ing>, <ing>onion powder</ing>, <ing>paprika</ing>, <ing>salt</ing>, and <ing>pepper</ing> to taste. Seasoning is largely up to interpretation- I’ve also used <ing>lawrys salt</ing> and <ing>red pepper flakes</ing> before
- Make sure the shrimp is evenly coated in the seasoning by mixing it in with a spatula or wooden spoon
- Make sure the shrimp is evenly cooked by flipping them over occasionally, until pink or curled/plumped up

### Step 3: add in the vegetables to the skillet

- add in the <ing>bell peppers</ing> and <ing>onion</ing> to the skillet, stir until they are the desired level of cooked/softness
- *(optional: add in <ing>Mexican rice</ing> as well)*

### Step 4: once the skillet is complete, turn off the heat and prepare the toppings!

- Fun toppings include Mexican rice (Mexican rice can also be added to the skillet with the vegetables in step 3 if desired), <ing>diced or sliced avocado</ing> (or guacamole if you want the extra flavor/tomatoes), black beans, sour cream, and <ing>shredded cheese</ing>
- Fajitas are totally up to the creator, so add <ing>any toppings that sound good</ing>

### Step 5: get a tortilla, and load it up, babey

### Step 6: yum
