*Friends have speculated it might be like eating sawdust. They’re wrong! The almond milk wets it down so you’re not choking, but it’s still firm enough to wake you up in the morning. And it doesn’t burn your mouth.*

### Ingredients

- <qu>1 cup</qu> Bob’s Red Mill Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats
- <qu>1 cup</qu> frozen blueberries
- <qu>1</qu> banana
- <qu>1 cup</qu> almond milk
- <qu>2 tbsp</qu> peanut butter (or more if you are greedy)

### Directions

1. Put oats and blueberries into a bowl and microwave for 2 minutes or until blueberries are fully melted and oats are hot.
2. Slice whole banana onto hot oats and blueberries.
3. Pour almond milk over hot oats and blueberries.
4. Top with peanut butter.

*And that’s it! Quick and tasty. It’s the perfect breakfast. I should know, I eat it every day.*
