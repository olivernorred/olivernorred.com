*&uarr; Photo from my mom. She always sends a pic of her dinner to the family WhatsApp group chat. Not super relevant but I thought it was a fun tidbit to share.*


*I was feeling a bit sick this weekend so I made myself some Indonesian comfort food: soto. There’s a bunch of different variations but generally, any traditional broth-based soup served with shredded meat, bean sprouts, vermicelli, and rice/rice cakes can be called soto. Soto ayam, or chicken soto, is the version I grew up eating so that’s what I ended up cooking.*

*I cheated a bit because I have a ready-made paste that works as a broth base but the full recipe calls for the following:*

### Ingredients
	
**Chicken**

- <qu>1</qu> boneless, skinless, chicken breast

**Broth**

- Bumbu Inti C (spice paste)
- Alternatively: candlenut, <qu>5</qu> shallots, <qu>3</qu> garlic cloves
- <qu>2 tbsp</qu> grated/finely minced ginger
- <qu>1 tsp</qu> kosher salt
- <qu>1 tsp</qu> black peppercorns
- <qu>2 stalks</qu> lemongrass bruised and tied in a knot
- <qu>Some</qu> turmeric
- Optional: <qu>1½</qu> tbsp coriander seeds, <qu>2 tsp</qu> cumin seeds, <qu>6</qu> makrut lime leaves

**Fixin’s**

- Vermicelli
- Rice or rice cakes (called lontong if you have them)
- <qu>2</qu> Eggs
- <qu>Some</qu> lime juice
- Chopped celery leaves (for garnish, you could also use basil, mint, cilantro, you name it)
- Fried Shallots 
- Sambal (oelek is easiest to find in the States, but chilis, garlic, and salt are the basics so you could make your own)

### Step 1

Place your <ing>chicken</ing> in a pot and cover with water. Boil with <ing>lemongrass</ing>, <ing>lime leaves</ing>, and <ing>salt</ing>. Simmer for about <qu>45 minutes</qu> then take chicken, lime leaves, and lemongrass out of the pot. You can discard lemongrass and lime leaves, keep the chicken and shred it in a bowl.

### Step 2

Meanwhile, put <ing>spices</ing>, <ing>garlic</ing>, <ing>shallots</ing>, and <ing>candlenut</ing> in a food processor and blend until it’s a paste. If you have <ing>Bumbu Inti</ing> you can just crush the spices or throw them in a spice grinder.

### Step 3

Throw a <qu>couple of tablespoons</qu> in a pan and put your paste in to bring out those flavors a bit. Saute until aromatic (about <qu>5 minutes</qu>). 

### Step 4

Add <ing>paste</ing> to your chicken stock (and also maybe some <ing>bouillon</ing> if you feel like it). Bring to a simmer and cook for about <qu>10 minutes</qu>.

### Step 5

Cook your <ing>noodles</ing> and boil your <ing>eggs</ing>.

### Step 6

Add <ing>lime</ing> and <ing>salt</ing> to your broth to taste.

### Step 7

Get your noodles or <ing>rice</ing> (or both) in a bowl, place eggs and shredded chicken on top then ladle broth over your bowl. Sprinkle with <ing>celery leaves</ing>, <ing>fried shallots</ing>, and add <ing>lime</ing> or <ing>sambal</ing> if you want. I also like to crush <ing>krupuk (prawn crackers)</ing> on top. Mix your soup around so all those flavors get to know each other and dig in.

*The steps in this recipe are mostly paraphrased from a New York Times [article](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012384-indonesian-chicken-soup-with-noodles-turmeric-and-ginger-soto-ayam) because I didn’t have that many exact measurements on hand. There’s a lot of room for adding your own touches to the soup so my only advice is have fun with it.*
