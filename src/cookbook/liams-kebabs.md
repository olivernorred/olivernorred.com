# Kebabs

Quarantine has left me with an abundance of extra time to learn how to cook. One of my favorite dishes I’ve learned how to make are chicken kebabs with a side of homemade tzatziki sauce. It is a tasty dish that always garners me compliments by my roommates and is surprisingly simple and fun to make. Marinating the kebab meat will be equally therapeutic and gross, and will leave your house smelling marvelous.
