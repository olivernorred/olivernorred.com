# Dutch Baby

*My mom used to make these for me when I was a kid from her Deep Canyon Tennis Club cookbook, so I can try and get that recipe when I’m home next but this is just what I do.*

### Ingredients

- <qu>2</qu> eggs
- <qu>1/2 cup</qu> flour
- <qu>1/2 cup</qu> milk
- <qu>2 tbsp</qu> granulated sugar
- <qu>a bit</qu> of salt
- <qu>any</qu> other flavoring you desire (I put vanilla extract but some nutmeg or something could be good too, just put something in so it isn’t boring)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to <qu>425 degrees</qu>, find a skillet or something that can go in the oven (with this amount you would probably want like a 9 or 10 inch, the one I use is like 8 inches and it puffs up huge above the edges, but that’s kinda fun) and put it in the oven while it’s heating
2. Pour all the ingredients into a Magic Bullet™ blender. Blend it, scrape the edges if you want, whatever. Just get it mixed up. Then you are supposed to let it sit to get the air bubbles out I think but I don’t really do that. 
3. When the oven is preheated, pull the hot skillet out and put <qu>~2 tbsp</qu> butter (I usually put a little less because <qu>2 tbsp</qu> tends to make a big pool of butter on top of the pancake after it is finished) into the bottom, swirling it around so it is evenly covering the bottom. Then pour the batter right into the middle and put it back in the oven. It should bake for like <qu>15-20 minutes</qu>, just watch for the edges to puff up and start to brown but don’t let them burn and get too dark. 
4. When it’s done, you can cut it into slices in the pan if you want but I’m a filthy pig so I eat the whole thing by myself and just scrape it out onto a plate. The bottom will stick a little and the pan will burn you if you touch it so this can be a difficult operation, but if you believe in yourself it is possible. Serve with something sweet on top, I usually use preserves. I think the classic is a dusting of powdered sugar and lemon juice which is very good but I don’t have powdered sugar or lemons right now. Maybe I should get some. Try some different stuff out and find out what you like I guess.
