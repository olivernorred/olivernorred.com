# Horchata

*I’m quite literally, most probably so, the worst cook in the world. However, that notion excludes my affinity for making the best beverages... so let me put you on something*

This is the most accurate recipe I found online, in comparison to the one I make of course. I was too lazy to write it down myself (college student things), but I think that recipe does the job. I cannot stress how IMPORTANT it is to **leave your rice to simmer** though. So if you ever try to make this yourself, don’t forget!!
