# Playing a free, outdoor show

## Oliver Norred, 25 September 2022

Dear readers,

All of Our Cornbread is playing a show at the UW Farm at the Center for Urban Horticulture on Friday, September 30th. The opener, esteemed and acclaimed folk duo The Rain Station, will play around 6:00pm. We will go on around 6:45pm.

It is free. It is outdoors. It is beautiful.

Come hear us _rock_! Buy a shirt, too, if you want.

&mdash;Oliver
