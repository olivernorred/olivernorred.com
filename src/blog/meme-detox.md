I’m doing a meme detox. I’ve seen enough memes. *Damn Daniel* can hold me over for a couple months, *My nama Jeff* another financial quarter. And I’m sure friends will show me new ones against my will. Memes aren’t good for my creativity, I think, so I’m taking a hiatus for about a year. I’ll be fine!
