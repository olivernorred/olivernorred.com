Stirring peanut butter has to be tedious and unpleasant.

...or so I used to think. I do not mourn the days before I discovered Trader Joe’s All Natural Salted Peanut Butter. I remember other brands gravely: The oil all over the counter that took cups of dish soap to cut through. The moistureless peanut gunk at the bottom of the jar that could bend a dragon-scale blade. The pain in my right arm after ten minutes of futile stirring, only to give up on that vile peanut butter rock who drowned in its own oily excretion.

I don’t know how Trader Joe’s makes stirring so easy. Nor how they achieve a perfect consistency so consistently. All I know is how much I love it.

Ten outta ten, Trader Joe’s. Very well done.
