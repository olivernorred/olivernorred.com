# A penny saved
## Oliver Norred, 29 September 2020

I’ve had a ton of time, so of course I’m on a pixel art kick. I wanted Aseprite, a popular pixel editor, thinking it would make me as talented as the artists on YouTube.

*[Aseprite.org](https://aseprite.org)*

The only problem was that it costs $20.


There was a hole in Aseprite’s scheme, though: despite being a paid software, Aseprite is open source. That means I can legally [download the source code for free](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/releases). But if I want the executable, I gotta compile the source code, which entails downloading a [bajillion other things](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/master/INSTALL.md#dependencies).

<blockquote>

<p><strong>To compile Aseprite you will need:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>The latest version of CMake (3.14 or greater)</li>

<li>Ninja build system</li>

<li>And a compiled version of the aseprite-m81 branch of the Skia library. There are pre-built packages available. You can get some extra information in the laf dependencies page.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Windows dependencies:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Windows 10 (we don't support cross-compiling)</li>

<li>Visual Studio Community 2019 (we don't support MinGW)</li>

<li>The Desktop development with C++ item + Windows 10.0.18362.0 SDK from the Visual Studio installer</li>

</ul>

</blockquote>

So I spent 3 hours downloading, troubleshooting, and ultimately compiling Aseprite’s source code. And it worked. $20 in 3 hours is less than minimum wage, but it’s not bad at all!


A penny saved is a penny earned. On the other hand, 3 hours wasted is 3 hours wasted. I almost don’t regret it.
