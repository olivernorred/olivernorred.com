**3/17/20**
Why are your strings so short and thin?\
And why do you play so ‘neath the din\
Of a battle fought hard against the sick and sin\
For 400Hz max, 40Hz min?

<br>

**5/4/20**
Think of the wants you want the most:\
Think of successes that you can boast;\
Think of the water, the wind, the coast;\
And think of delicious butter on toast!\
These are some wants; you want them, you know.\
But your needs . . .\
Now, only those you can sow!

<br>

**5/10/20**
A son defines a mother,\
As mother guides her son.\
To wish for any other\
Is mistake number one!\
A sibling—sister, brother\
Can repair love undone,\
But long as you’ve a mother,\
Her love’s already won.

<br>

**6/11/20**
To take a work\
And make it fly\
Is quite the perk\
I can’t deny.\
But hold you not\
Your pride so high . . .\
That wingèd yacht\
Fell from the sky!

<br>

**8/7/20**
Been saying\
This for years.\
Fries are thin,\
Beef is thin,\
Buns are thin,\
Lines are long . . .\
What’s to like?

<br>

**8/14/20**
New places, new people, everything’s new.\
I’d live here; it feels like I already do.\
When you’re with a family that is yours to choose,\
Life becomes fresh, and the world renews.

<br>

**8/14/20**
The early bird gets the worm, they say,\
But is it worth the bleary, red eyes?\
I’d pass up the worm almost any day,\
Though I might wake to see the sun rise.
