Why am I still oily? I’m not a teenager anymore.

Not sure if it’s because I take morning showers, so my bedsheets collect day-grime each night?

Maybe it’s because I use shampoo daily so my hair and scalp over-produce oil?

If you have experience with oiliness past your teens, please leave a comment. I need to know what to expect.
