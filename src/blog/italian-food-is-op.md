# Italian food is O.P.
## Oliver Norred, 14 November 2020

Heard someone say their favorite food is “anything Italian.” I realized that’s my answer too. It’s almost unfair. They’ve got pizza and pasta, for *pizzake*!

Even saying pasta is my favorite food would be okay. There are infinite pastas, and none of them are bad. Pasta tastes good when it’s two weeks old, gluten free, and covered in pre-shredded parmesan.

Close your eyes. Try to imagine eating a bowl of pasta and feeling anything but fullness and mirth. I can’t.

Thanks for the memories, Italian food!
