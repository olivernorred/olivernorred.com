# They made a new pasta
## Oliver Norred, 5 May 2021

*They made a new pasta.*

O, how I long to kiss the Cascatelli \
And let long lost sauce find me just as lost in it.

O, how I long to bite the new pasta, \
Who, so coy, sits plump on the shelf, \
Just outside my grasp. \
And whose tight curls are all but around my chest, \
In a hug.

O, the new pasta, the new maiden in town, \
You, Cascatelli, it was always you.

Sweep me off my feet; \
Iâ€™ve fallen.
