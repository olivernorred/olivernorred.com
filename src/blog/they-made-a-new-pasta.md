# They made a new pasta
## Oliver Norred, 5 May 2021

*They made a new pasta.*

O, how I long to kiss the Cascatelli \
And let long lost sauce find me so lost in it.

O, how I long to toothe the new pasta, \
Not in doggish violence but in cattish horns.

O, how I should touch the new pasta, \
Who, so coy, sits plump on her shelf, \
Just past my grasp, \
And whose tight curls should be around my chest, \
In a hug.

O, the new pasta, the new maiden, \
You, Cascatelli, it was always you.

Sweep me off my feet; \
Iâ€™ve fallen.
