# How to make peace with running
## Oliver Norred, 3 May 2021

I am still at war with running. It is cooling down; I’ve withdrawn about half my troops since the weather got warmer. But as long as my dad’s sleek Craigslist road bike is in the garage, it will not be easy to fall back in love with the joint killer that is jogging. Here’s my strategy:

***Take It Easy: Two Prohibitions To Keep Running Fun***

Running track and cross country through junior year warped my idea of a good workout. I still find myself speeding up at the beginning because I think I can maintain the same pace as high school. I cannot! My mom has suggested only breathing through my nose. Anyway, that’s *Prohibition Number One: Running Too Fast*.

Six or seven weeks ago, I watched *Breaking Away* (1979), the bikers’ bildungsroman. It made me get on the bike, and I’m hooked. I don’t want to lose biking just because I resumed running. That’s *Prohibition Number Two: Losing My Biking Habit*.

I hope that, with these two rules in place, running and I will be able to [make it better](https://youtu.be/7Jj83FOlBF8).
