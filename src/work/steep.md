Steep connects people who seek socialization in a third place. Users attach conversation-starting status updates (&ldquo;pins&rdquo;) to their location in space.

<p class="caption">A third place is somewhere, neither home nor work, that serves as a place for socialization. Think of it as a social network combined with a conversation starter.</p>
