The UW Farm grows and sells produce, but one of its most important exports is education about urban agriculture, the food system, and food security. With large signs throughout the farm’s Center for Urban Horticulture location, we aim to expand this education not just to those who involve themselves with farm activities, but also to the many community members who pass through the farm every day. Some of the signs have interactive lift-flaps, and all of them have Braille titles.

<p>Four signs, three with liftable flaps, were installed at the UW Farm’s Center for Urban Horticulture location. There are two entrance signs, one sign explaining where the UW Farm sends its produce, and one sign about the UW Farm’s vermicomposting facility.</p>
