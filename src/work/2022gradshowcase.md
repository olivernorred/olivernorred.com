I designed and developed the website for the UW SOA+AH+D graduate showcase at the Henry Art Gallery with a goal to preserve the event as well as possible.

Like many UW websites, this site has a WordPress backend and CMS, so the development side involved some minimal CSS and *a lot* of organized uploading. It also saved some time to have last year’s layout to look at.

I designed the digital render identity from the idea that this website is a digital recreation of a real-life event. The light blue link-highlight color complements hues in the render.
