I designed and developed the website for the UW SOA+AH+D graduate showcase with a goal to preserve the event as well as possible.

Like many UW websites, this site uses WordPress, so the development side involved some minimal CSS and a lot of uploading. It also saved some time to have last year’s layout to look at.

I designed the digital grainy identity with the idea that this was a digital recreation of a real-life event. The light blue link-highlight color came from the tones on the main hero image.
