<h1>A better way to read Skyrim books!</h1>
<p><a href="https://skyrimbooksproj.web.app/">VIEW SITE &rarr;</a></p>
<p>My friend, <a href="https://rileysamuelhuston.com">Riley</a>, knew there had to be an easier way to read <i>Skyrim</i> books. His website of choice, <a href="https://www.imperial-library.info/books/tes5%3Askyrim/by-category">imperial-library.info</a>, reads poorly on mobile devices. Worse yet, it uses "straight quotes." <i>Ugh.</i> He had started cleaning up texts into MS Word docs, but he contacted me in hopes we could put them on the internet. I obliged.</p>
<p>Compiling and beautifying every book in <i>Skyrim</i> was a test of file management, robust design, and patience.</p>
<p><a href="https://skyrimbooksproj.web.app/">The result</a> is a pleasure to read and navigate on all screen sizes.</p>
