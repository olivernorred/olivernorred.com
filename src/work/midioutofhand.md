MIDI Out of Hand is a MIDI controller that reads big, expressive movements by the player or players. To activate a note, a player presses a footswitch. The sound can be modified by pulling either of the retractable cords from the upper part of the instrument: by default, the left cord controls the filter cutoff, and the right cord controls the pitch shift, but they can be mapped to any parameter in a DAW.

MIDI Out of Hand attempts to expand the kinetic vocabulary of electronic instruments. This pursuit opened the final instrument to be played in novel ways, like by multiple people at a time.

This project also prompted a process for instrument prototyping. In a workshop shown in the following video, participants pretended to “play” nearby large objects—like a recycling bin, a paper cutter, and a ladder—as though they were instruments. We used a keyboard to produce sounds that roughly mirror the movements they were making, and determined what movement-sound combinations were most interesting and realistic.

## At the 2023 Seattle Design Festival

I showed MIDI Out of Hand at the <a href="https://seadesignfest.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SDF2023_YearInReview.pdf">2023 Seattle Design Festival</a>, where amid other bustling installations strangers experimented with the controller for a few hours.

Visitors of all ages got to see, feel, hear, and ask about the power of prototyping with Arduino and MIDI data.
