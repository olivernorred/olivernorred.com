<p>I have a soft spot for projects that are unambitious but turn out useful. So when I was trying to find stuff on the coronavirus eviction moratorium in Seattle and Washington state, and it took me more than ten minutes to find anything of worth, I made a website with a tiny goal: itâ€™s just a table of links.</p>

<div class="browsermockup">
<a href="https://seattleevictionmoratorium.info"><img src="/images/work/evictionmoratorium/seattleevictionmoratorium_cover.png" alt="The webpage for seattleevictionmoratorium.info"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">The first and only page on the website.</p>

<p>It is <a href="https://github.com/olivernorred/eviction-moratorium-info">open source on GitHub</a>, so if you know any useful resources, add them to the table! The data is all in <code>links.csv</code>. The rest of the code is just prettily displaying that table.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I developed a three-color solution that takes inspiration from punk rock and protest music designs, tilting the black backgrounds and setting a drop shadow.</p>

<p>The type treatment is the same as on this website! Degular for the headers and Literata at a small optical size for the body copy.</p>
