<h1>Cookbook Collab</h1>

<p>For my blog, I asked a bunch of friends to send me a recipe. It was little more than an excuse to play around with <code>&lt;ol></code>s and <code>&lt;ul></code>s (instructions and ingredients, respectively).</p>

<p><a href="/cookbook/">Read the cookbook &rarr;</a></p>

<p class="caption">The table of contents features gradient-filled text to evoke the heat of the kitchen!</p>

<p>The font for the headings is <em>Taters</em>, a potato-inspired font by <a href="https://tommisharp.com/taters">Tommi Sharp</a>.</p>

<p>Many of the recipes were handwritten or texted to me, so I made sure to capture what it felt like to navigate the originals, while also keeping every recipe in uniform style with the rest of the cookbook.</p>

<p>Another (more famous) recipe compilation like this is Questlove’s <em>Mixtape Potluck</em>. He strives less for maintaining the original format and more for telling his own story about the recipe. I love that book!</p>
