This was my first time designing and building an ecommerce site. Montana had a Shopify account set up already, so I dug into everything I could.

One challenge was deciding how to divide the store between products that could be shipped and those that had to be hand delivered. Our solution was making one page for shippable products and one for local-only products.

I used Shopify’s tags system to make it easy, sustainable, and automatic for Montana to make additions and changes long after I’m gone.

Shopify has some benefits and drawbacks. I did have a layout from the start, but it was tough to customize. And the in-browser code editor made it tough to test changes.
