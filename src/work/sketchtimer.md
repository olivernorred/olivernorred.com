# Quick Sketch

A niche timer app for artists, designers, and illustrators to practice quick sketching. Every line was hand-drawn.

I was inspired by the theme of this app to design micro-interactions using pen and paper. All the animations are drawn frame by frame on paper.

## Sound design

The vocal countdown and triumphant timer-end sound were a short exercise in sound design. I have to assume that when a user is sketching, they are not watching the app screen; thus an audio cue is not only fun, it is necessary.
